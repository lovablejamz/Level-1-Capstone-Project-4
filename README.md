This program is designed for a shoe company to manage stock at various branches using data read from a text file (inventory.txt). It allows the user to add, view, restock, and search for a shoe.

The user is presented with the following menu:
- 1 - capture shoes - this allows the user to capture data about a shoe and writes this data to a new line in inventory.txt.
- 2 - view all - this displays the details of each shoe, i.e country, code, product, price and quantity.
- 3 - re-stock - this displays the counntry with the lowest shoe quantity and asks the user if they want to add to the quantity and then update it. This quantity will be                  updated on the file for this shoe.
- 4 - search shoe - the user is prompted to enter the code of the shoe that they want to search for, and the details of the shoe that matches the inputted code will be                       displayed.
